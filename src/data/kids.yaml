  desc: "<b>This Month: <i>Sunny Song Will Never Be Famous</i> by Suzanne Park</b><br>Sunny Song's Big Summer Goals: [1] Make Rafael Kim my boyfriend (finally!) [2] Hit 100K followers (almost there...) [3] Have the best last summer of high school ever. Not on Sunny's list? Accidentally filming a PG-13 cooking video that goes viral â€”III (#browniegate). Extremely not on her list? Being shipped off to a digital-detox farm camp in Iowa (IOWA??) for a whole month. She's trading in her Wi-Fi connection for a butter churn, and if she wants any shot at growing her social media platform this summer, she'll need to find a way back online. But between some unexpected friendships and an alarmingly cute farm boy, Sunny might be surprised by the connections she makes when she's forced to disconnect."
