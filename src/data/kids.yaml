  desc: "<b>This Month: <i>The Girl from the Well</i> by Rin Chupeco</b><br><br>&ldquo;A dead girl walks the streets. She hunts murderers. Child killers, much like the man who threw her body down a well three hundred years ago. And when a strange boy bearing stranger tattoos moves into the neighborhood so, she discovers, does something else. And soon both will be drawn into the world of eerie doll rituals and dark Shinto exorcisms that will take them from American suburbia to the remote valleys and shrines of Aomori, Japan. Because the boy has a terrifying secret- one that would just kill to get out.&rdquo;<br><br>Available as an eBook and eAudio for free on hooplaDigital."
