    Alert type - goes in the first set of quotes
        There are 3 types of alerts that correlate to different icon + color schemes:
            "inf" (info)      - blue; used for low-priority situations and normal closings such as holidays.
            "att" (attention) - yellow; medium-priority alerts, used for far-in-advance delays/early closings and irregular closings such as staff training days.
            "crit" (critical) - red; high-priority alerts, used for unplanned emergency closings/delays.
    Data expiration tag - goes in the second set of quotes
        Specifies when the alert should stop being shown to end users.
        Formatted in MM/DD/YYYY format, optionally with hh:mm to set the time of expiration.
            If the time value is omitted, the alert will expire at 8:00 PM of the specified date.
            If the value is omitted completely, the alert will not expire until removed manually.
    Span field - follows the "span" below the indented alert tag
        THIS FIELD MUST BE INDENTED FOLLOWING THE ALERT TAG IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.
        This is the message that will be displayed inside the alert.
        Formatted in plain text and/or HTML.
        You can use <b>SomeMessageInBold</b> or #[b SomeMessageInBold] to make text bold.

    Example code:

    alert("att")(data-expires="02/03/24 11:59 PM")
        span Raritan Public Library will be closed on #[b Tuesday, February 3rd] due to #[b inclement weather].

alert("crit")//-(data-expires="02/03/24 11:59 PM")
    span Raritan Public Library will be closed #[b until further notice] due to a #[b water main break].
